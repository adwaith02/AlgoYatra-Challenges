# 🧭 AlgoYatra: The Weekly Challenge Series

Welcome to **AlgoYatra** — a journey through algorithms and data structures, one challenge at a time.

Every week, we release a new problem designed to sharpen your thinking, refine your coding skills, and explore multiple problem-solving approaches. Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned developer, **AlgoYatra** is for anyone looking to grow through consistent practice.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Weekly Challenges**
   A new challenge is published every week in this repository under its own folder. You have a full week to solve it.

2. **Flexible Submissions**
   Solve the problem in **any programming language** or paradigm you prefer — object-oriented, functional, scripting — you name it.

3. **Weekly Gathering**
   At the end of each week, we’ll host a discussion to break down the challenge, share solutions, and introduce the next one.

## 📁 Folder Structure

Each challenge lives inside a dedicated folder. For example:

```
/01-BrowserChallenges
  └── 01-BrowserNavigation
      ├── solution.py
      └── README.md (Problem statement)
```

Participants clone the structure and add their solutions in the respective folder.
